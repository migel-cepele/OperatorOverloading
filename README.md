# OperatorOverloading  
Exercises with operator overloading in C++.  

# Overview  
This repository contains a set of C++ exercises demonstrating how operator overloading works. Operator overloading allows you to redefine the way operators work for user-defined types (classes and structs), making your code more intuitive and expressive.  
These exercises are designed to understand when and why to use operator overloading syntax for overloading common operators (+, -, *, /, =, [], <<, >>, etc.)  
# Features  
📚 Multiple C++ files, each showcasing different operator overloading techniques  
📝 Well-commented code to aid understanding  
🚦 Examples include arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and stream operators
